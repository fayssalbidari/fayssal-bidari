  "Into the Trail": {
    date: "2025",
    desc1: "Into the Trail is an immersive web experience inspired by the world of hiking, nature, and adventure. The project invites users to step off the beaten path and explore a digital trail filled with motion, atmosphere, and storytelling. Designed with a focus on escapism and visual poetry, the site captures the spirit of outdoor exploration through a mix of impactful imagery, smooth transitions, and dynamic layouts.",
    desc2: "This project was also an opportunity to experiment with web storytelling and animation techniques. From scroll-based interactions to ambient sound design, every element was crafted to support a sense of progression—as if the user were truly walking through the experience. The challenge was to create a digital journey that feels organic, fluid, and emotionally resonant.",
    desc3: "Into the Trail stands out as a conceptual project, allowing me to blend my design sensibilities with advanced frontend techniques. It demonstrates my ability to build experiences that go beyond standard websites, focusing on emotion, immersion, and user engagement. It’s a personal homage to nature, adventure, and the idea of slow, mindful discovery.",

  "Muzic PLZ": {
    date: "2025",
    desc1: "Music PLZ is an immersive web project designed to introduce users to a musical universe through an interactive and visually engaging website. I chose to focus on Laylow, specifically his album Trinity, a work deeply influenced by futuristic sounds and a strong digital identity. The site invites users to dive into this world, placing music at the core of the experience, supported by a visual language inspired by cyberpunk, Matrix, and retro-digital aesthetics.",
    desc2: "The design draws from dark, tech-oriented themes, echoing the topics explored in the album—introspection, loneliness, and the complex relationship between humans and machines. The interface was carefully crafted to reflect the identity of Trinity, while offering a modern web experience: smooth transitions, dynamic animations, multimedia integration, and intuitive navigation all enhance the immersive feel of Laylow’s universe.",
    desc3: "This project was an opportunity to combine my skills in design and frontend development. The site is fully responsive, and includes CSS/JS animations, a slider, a burger menu, and embedded audio. The result is a tribute to Laylow’s world, aiming not only to showcase his music but to deliver a visual and sensory experience that aligns with his unique artistic style.",

  "Casa Lunara": {
    date: "2024",
    desc1: "Casa Lunara is a fictional brand concept built around futuristic and creative eyewear design. The website offers a bold and immersive experience that blends innovation, style, and imagination. Entirely imagined as a showcase for cutting-edge optical creations, the project aims to push visual boundaries while evoking a sleek and forward-thinking aesthetic. From the concept to the execution, the site plays with the codes of luxury and futurism, where technology and design meet.",
    desc2: "This project was also a personal challenge: it’s the first website I built using Webflow, under the mentorship of Karim Saab, an award-winning freelance designer with multiple recognitions from Awwwards. The goal was to explore new design and development techniques, notably the integration of a WebGL slider with a depth map, to create a dynamic and engaging browsing experience. Artificial intelligence also played a key role in the creative process, helping to generate visuals that align with the brand's vision.",
    desc3: "With Casa Lunara, I aimed to break away from conventional web formats and dive into more experimental design. The result is a high-concept visual identity that serves as both a portfolio piece and a playground for creative innovation.",

    desc1: "La Cabane Studio is a creative digital studio born from friendship and a shared passion for art, design, and immersive experiences. Based in Brussels, the studio was founded with the ambition to support and promote local artists through interactive websites and bold visual storytelling. More than just an agency, La Cabane positions itself as an artist-collective, blending digital innovation with artistic expression.",
    desc2: "The name “La Cabane” comes from a real wooden cabin in the back of a garden—our favorite meeting spot, where ideas flow freely and creative energy thrives. This spirit of warmth, authenticity, and collaboration is at the heart of our identity. We don’t follow traditional corporate codes—we treat each project like a creative piece, and each collaboration like a co-authored work of art. Our goal is to build meaningful digital experiences that reflect the soul of the people and cultures we work with.",
    desc3: "La Cabane is also a space for experimentation. We constantly explore new formats, immersive techniques, and artistic crossovers to reinvent how stories are told online. Whether through motion design, soundscapes, WebGL, or AI-driven visuals, we aim to merge technology with emotion. Our dream is to become a hub for Brussels’ creative scene—where art meets code, and bold ideas find a home.",

  "ParaLab": {
    date: "2024",
    desc1: "ParaLab is an interactive project designed to promote awareness around accessibility issues and adaptive sports (handisport). Developed collaboratively with my team, our initiative aims to shine a light on the everyday challenges faced by people with reduced mobility (PRM). Our concept centers around an interactive digital kiosk installed in our university's gymnasium, providing an immersive and educational experience through practical sports activities.",
    desc2: "The kiosk invites users to participate in various sporting challenges, performed both regularly and with simulated mobility impairments (such as performing tasks blindfolded or using mobility-limiting equipment). By comparing their performances with those of Paralympic athletes, participants gain insight and appreciation for the exceptional abilities of athletes living with disabilities. Additionally, the kiosk offers rich multimedia content—including personal testimonials, informative articles, and an interactive map detailing accessibility in public spaces throughout Namur.",
    desc3: "Through thoughtful design and inclusive interactivity, ParaLab strives not only to educate but also to foster empathy and appreciation toward adaptive sports and accessibility efforts. This project combines our skills in interface design, front-end development, and user experience optimization, aligning with universal design principles to ensure usability for all. Ultimately, ParaLab aims to bridge awareness gaps, encourage open dialogue, and contribute positively to a more inclusive community.",

  "Rethinking UX": {
    date: "2025",
    desc1: "Rethinking UX is a collaborative project focused on reimagining how school spaces can be both visually engaging and educational. Our team decided to design and produce a large, printable banner to be displayed in a classroom. This colorful and luminous banner aims to brighten up the space while serving a practical purpose: introducing students to a wide variety of typefaces and helping them understand their potential uses in design.",
    desc2: "The real challenge was to make multiple fonts coexist harmoniously on a single visual support, while remaining accessible and readable at first glance. Each typeface featured on the banner is accompanied by guidance about its best use cases—whether for titles, body text, or decorative accents—and warnings on how not to use it. The goal was to make typography both approachable and inspiring, especially for students in creative fields.",
    desc3: "We also made sure that all the fonts selected were free and accessible, so that anyone interested in using them could easily do so without licensing issues. This banner is not just a decorative object; it is a pedagogical tool, designed using methods of user-centered design and produced with the school's in-house printing resources. The result is a visually striking piece that educates by design.",
